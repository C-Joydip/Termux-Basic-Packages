# Termux-Basic-Packages 
With this tool you can install most of your basic packags of Turmex by just pressing a button.

Commands:
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Hydra83/Termux-Basic-Packages
$ cd Termux-Basic-Packages
$ bash setup.sh

If you want to use my tool next time just write Termux and ENTER.

Happy Hacking.
